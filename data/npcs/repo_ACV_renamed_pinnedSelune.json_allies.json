She believes in mercy, but her aim is quicker; her laughter is soft and warm and gone the second trouble creaks in the brush. She moves like a deer about to bolt, then turns and plants both feet like a tree; voice low, bowstring singing, eyes bright with the kind of faith that only breaks when it must. Her questions are sharp, and when she smiles after, it’s half relief, half dare. Physique and style reflect their forest elf heritage: Tall, slender; bronze to olive skin; leaf-dyed hair and floral tattoos; bright woodland eyes and effortless stealth. Appearance: medium, straight, blonde hair; crimson eyes; fair, smooth skin; medium height, athletic build. Features: pointed ears.  Personality: calm, observant, quietly determined. She wears quiet leathers, leaf-dyed cloak, soft boots, beadwork and feather charms.
