      "description": "All turquoise smooth skin and green eyes, she carries a curvy build at tall height; medium straight blonde hair. Her heritage is obvious: light green or turquoise smooth skin, antler-like white or light-white light brown antler-like pointed horns, and a short fur-short fur-tipped tail matching skin color matching the skin tone. A Viridian Tiefling ally who carries herself with distinction. She wears a flowing embroidered robe and sleeveless overcloak, a vine belt with pouches, leaf-stitched bracers, a long skirt with slits and strapped sandals.. She wears attire suited to her station and embody the presence of her bloodline. She wears city finery—tailored waistcoat, lace jabot and slim trousers—no leaves, only luxury."
